        Adds a polygon feature, such as a model boundary or a refinement zone.

            zone_id (int or str): A unique identifier for the zone.
            resolution (float, optional): Target mesh size within this polygon. If None,
                the background mesh size will be used.
            z_order (int): Stacking order for resolving overlaps. Higher values are
                processed first and will "cut" into lower-order polygons. Also acts
                as the crossing priority when this polygon's quad buffer crosses
                another quad-buffered feature (higher stays continuous). To control
                the two independently, add the zone without ``quad_buffer`` and add
                its boundary as a separate quad-buffered line with its own z_order.
            dist_min (float, optional): DEPRECATED. Distance from the polygon boundary where
                the mesh size is held constant at the boundary's resolution. Supplying
                dist_min/dist_max selects the legacy linear ThresholdField transition and
                emits a DeprecationWarning; omit them to use the default GeometricGrowthField.
            dist_max (float, optional): DEPRECATED. Distance from the polygon boundary over
                which the mesh transitions to the background resolution. See dist_min.
            growth_factor (float, optional): Cell-to-cell growth ratio (>1.0) for the default
                GeometricGrowthField size transition away from the feature. Defaults to 1.2.
                Ignored when an explicit ``fields`` list or the legacy dist_min/dist_max is given.
            densify (float|bool|None, optional): Controls polygon boundary densification:
                - If False, disables densification.
                - If True, densifies using `resolution` (lc). Requires `resolution` to be set.
                - If a float, densifies so no boundary segment is longer than this value.
                Raises ValueError if non-positive when specified as a float.
            simplify_tolerance (float|int|None, optional): If a number > 0, applies Douglas-Peucker

            embed (bool): If True, the polygon is embedded in the mesh. If False, it is used only for fields.
            quad_buffer (bool): If True, replaces the meshed polygon outline
                with a quad band straddling it (the annulus between the
                ``+/- thickness * resolution / 2`` offsets, meshed as
                recombined quads; annuli cannot be 4-corner transfinite). The
                outline itself never becomes mesh edges: with
                ``quad_buffer_thickness=1`` no nodes fall on it, so the Voronoi
                cell faces trace the shapefile shape; with ``2`` a node row

                shape. (For the triangular element-grid deliverable the reading

                feature (``z_order``, then finer resolution, wider strip, lines
                over polygons) stays continuous and only the other is trimmed
